# fraud-analytics-report

### **Project Goal**
This project aims to analyze transaction data to identify fraud patterns and measure their financial impact. The primary focus is on exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of fraudulent transactions and the losses they incur.

### **Methodology**
The analysis was conducted using Python with the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries within a Jupyter Notebook. The key steps performed include:
1.  **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing**: Ensuring the data is ready for analysis, including handling missing values and data type conversions.
2.  **Fraud Incident Frequency Analysis**: Calculating the fraud ratio based on various variables such as age, location, and transaction amount.
3.  **Financial Impact Analysis**: Quantifying the total financial loss caused by fraud and comparing its distribution with non-fraudulent transactions.

### **Key Findings**
* **Total Loss**: Identifying the total monetary value of losses due to fraud, providing a clear picture of the financial impact.
* **Loss Distribution**: Visualizing that fraudulent transactions tend to have a higher monetary value, highlighting the importance of mitigating fraud on large-sum transactions.
* **Key Patterns**: Uncovering significant fraud patterns based on specific age groups and transaction amounts.

### **Files**
* `fraud.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis code and visualizations.
* `data/`: The directory containing the dataset used (optional, if the data can be shared).
